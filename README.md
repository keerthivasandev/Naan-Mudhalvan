# News Media Application

A news application is a big interactive database that tells a news story. Think of it like you would any other piece of journalism. It just uses software instead of words and pictures. With using react, node and other trending softwares, we are inclined to create the seemless news media application.

### Software requirements: Node.js and React.js
